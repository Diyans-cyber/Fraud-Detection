Fraud Detection Data Analysis

Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using data analysis and machine learning techniques. Fraud detection is a critical task in financial services and e-commerce to prevent losses and secure customer transactions. The project involves exploring transaction data, visualizing patterns, and applying machine learning models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
